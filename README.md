# Contoso University Project (asd-net-mvc)

A simple demo with ASP.NET MVC 5 and Entity Framework 6, using the Code First development approach.

This is a simple repository for the LAB 3 of .NET Architecture discipline, at Distributed Software Architecture postgraduate and also for future reference.

It was based in [Contoso University](https://github.com/iec-asd-net/ContosoUniversity) repository, which in turn is based on [Getting Started with Entity Framework 6 Code First using MVC 5](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/mvc/overview/getting-started/getting-started-with-ef-using-mvc/creating-an-entity-framework-data-model-for-an-asp-net-mvc-application) tutorial.
